# Updated Forgot Password Flow - Code Sent on Modal Click

## Issue Fixed
Previously, the reset code was only sent when clicking "Resend" in the verify-reset screen. Now the code is sent immediately when the user clicks "Okay, Got It" from the modal.

## Updated Flow

### 1. **Forget Password Screen** (`forgetPassword.tsx`)
- User enters email address
- Clicks "Submit" button
- **Action**: Shows modal immediately (no backend call here)
- **UI**: Modal appears with "Okay, Got It" button

### 2. **Email Reset Modal** (`emailResetSeen.tsx`) - **UPDATED**
- Displays confirmation message
- **NEW**: When "Okay, Got It" is clicked:
  - Sends POST request to `/forgot-password` with email
  - Shows "Sending Code..." loading state
  - Navigates to verify-reset screen
- **Result**: User gets the 6-character code immediately

### 3. **Verify Reset Screen** (`verify-reset.tsx`)
- User enters the 6-character code they just received
- **Resend button**: Still works for sending another code if needed
- **Verify button**: Validates the code and proceeds to reset password

### 4. **Reset Password Screen** (`resetPassword.tsx`)
- User enters new password
- Password is reset and user is redirected to login

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Email Reset Modal** (`emailResetSeen.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `authService` import
- ✅ Added `isSendingCode` state for loading
- ✅ Created `handleOkayGotIt` function that:
  - Calls `authService.forgotPassword(emailAddress)`
  - Shows loading state ("Sending Code...")
  - Handles errors gracefully
  - Closes modal and navigates to verify-reset
- ✅ Updated button to show loading state

### 2. **Forget Password Screen** (`forgetPassword.tsx`)
- ✅ Simplified `handleSubmit` function
- ✅ Removed backend API call (moved to modal)
- ✅ Removed loading state and error handling
- ✅ Removed unused `isSubmitting` state
- ✅ Button now just shows modal immediately

## User Experience Improvement

### Before:
1. User enters email → clicks Submit
2. Modal shows → user clicks "Okay, Got It"
3. User goes to verify-reset screen
4. **User has to click "Resend" to get the code**

### After:
1. User enters email → clicks Submit
2. Modal shows → user clicks "Okay, Got It"
3. **Code is sent immediately**
4. User goes to verify-reset screen
5. **Code is already in their email!**

## Benefits

- ✅ **Faster user experience** - code arrives immediately
- ✅ **No extra clicks** - user doesn't need to click "Resend"
- ✅ **Better UX flow** - code is ready when user reaches verify screen
- ✅ **Loading feedback** - user sees "Sending Code..." while waiting
- ✅ **Error handling** - graceful handling if code sending fails

## Testing the Updated Flow

1. **Navigate to** `/auth/forgetPassword`
2. **Enter email** and click "Submit"
3. **Click "Okay, Got It"** in modal (code is sent immediately)
4. **Check email** - 6-character code should be there
5. **Enter code** in verify-reset screen
6. **Click "Verify"** to proceed
7. **Enter new password** in reset password screen
8. **Click "Submit"** to complete reset
9. **Navigate to login** screen automatically

The flow is now much more user-friendly with the code being sent at the right moment!
