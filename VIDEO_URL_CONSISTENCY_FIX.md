# Video URL Consistency Fix

## Problem Identified

The video URLs used in the homepage (ContentCard) were different from the URLs used in the library components, causing inconsistent video playback behavior.

### Root Cause

1. **ContentCard (Homepage)**: Was using `getSafeVideoUrl()` to process `content.mediaUrl` before playback
2. **Library Components**: Were using `item.fileUrl` directly (which is the correct URL)
3. **When saving to library**: `content.mediaUrl` was saved as `fileUrl` in the library
4. **The discrepancy**: `getSafeVideoUrl()` was modifying the URL, making it different from what was stored in the library

## Solution Implemented

Updated ContentCard to use the same URL that gets saved to the library, ensuring consistency across all components.

### Changes Made

#### app/components/ContentCard.tsx

1. **Removed URL processing**: Removed `getSafeVideoUrl()` usage
2. **Direct URL usage**: Now uses `content.mediaUrl` directly, same as what gets saved to library
3. **Simplified initialization**: Removed complex URL validation and refresh logic
4. **Consistent behavior**: Video URLs now match between homepage and library

### Before vs After

#### Before (Inconsistent)

```typescript
// ContentCard - processed URL
const safeUrl = await getSafeVideoUrl(content.mediaUrl, content._id);
setCurrentVideoUrl(safeUrl);

// Library - direct URL
const safeVideoUri = isValidUri(item.fileUrl) ? item.fileUrl : fallback;
```

#### After (Consistent)

```typescript
// ContentCard - direct URL (same as library)
setCurrentVideoUrl(content.mediaUrl);

// Library - direct URL (unchanged)
const safeVideoUri = isValidUri(item.fileUrl) ? item.fileUrl : fallback;
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Video Playback**: Same video URL used in homepage and library
2. **Simplified Code**: Removed unnecessary URL processing complexity
3. **Better Performance**: No more URL validation delays
4. **Reliable Behavior**: Videos work the same way everywhere in the app

## Files Modified

- `app/components/ContentCard.tsx` - Updated to use direct URLs

## Testing

The fix ensures that:

- ✅ Homepage videos use the same URL as library videos
- ✅ Video playback is consistent across all components
- ✅ No more URL processing discrepancies
- ✅ Simplified and more reliable video handling

The video URLs are now consistent between the homepage preview and library playback.
