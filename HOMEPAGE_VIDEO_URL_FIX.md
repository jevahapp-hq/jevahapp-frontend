# Homepage Video URL Fix

## Problem Identified

The homepage ContentCard was showing "failed URL" errors for videos that worked perfectly in the library page, even though both were using the same video URLs.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **error handling approach**:

### Library (Working)

- Uses simple URL validation with fallback
- Has basic error handling with `console.warn`
- Uses `safeVideoUri` with BigBuckBunny fallback
- No complex retry logic

### ContentCard (Failing)

- Used complex URL processing with `getSafeVideoUrl()`
- Had aggressive error handling with `console.error` and alerts
- Used `currentVideoUrl` state management
- Had complex retry logic that could cause issues

## Solution Implemented

Updated ContentCard to use the **exact same approach** as the library components:

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Simplified URL Handling**

```typescript
// Before: Complex state management
const [currentVideoUrl, setCurrentVideoUrl] = useState<string>(
  content.mediaUrl
);

// After: Same as library
const isValidUri = (u: any) =>
  typeof u === "string" && u.trim().length > 0 && /^https?:\/\//.test(u.trim());

const safeVideoUri = isValidUri(content.mediaUrl)
  ? String(content.mediaUrl).trim()
  : "https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4";
```

#### 2. **Simplified Video Component**

```typescript
// Before: Complex error handling
<Video
  source={{ uri: currentVideoUrl }}
  onError={(error: any) => {
    console.error(`❌ Video loading error:`, error);
    // Complex retry logic with alerts
  }}
/>

// After: Same as library
<Video
  source={{ uri: safeVideoUri }}
  onError={(error: any) => {
    console.warn(`❌ Video loading error:`, error);
    // Simple error handling
  }}
/>
```

#### 3. **Removed Complex Logic**

- Removed `getSafeVideoUrl()` processing
- Removed complex retry mechanisms
- Removed URL state management
- Simplified error handling

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent Behavior**: Homepage now works exactly like library
2. **Reliable Fallback**: BigBuckBunny fallback for invalid URLs
3. **Simplified Code**: Removed unnecessary complexity
4. **Better Performance**: No more URL processing delays
5. **Same Error Handling**: Consistent user experience

## Files Modified

- `app/components/ContentCard.tsx` - Updated to match library approach

## Result

The homepage videos now use the exact same URL handling and error management as the library, ensuring consistent video playback across the entire app. If a video works in the library, it will work on the homepage too!
