# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Performance Optimizations

### Button Response & Data Fetching Improvements

The app has been optimized to resolve slow button responses and data fetching issues:

#### Key Performance Features:

1. **Optimized Button Handling**:
   - Immediate visual feedback using `InteractionManager`
   - Debounced button presses to prevent rapid successive calls
   - Background processing for heavy operations

2. **Enhanced Data Fetching**:
   - Request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls
   - Intelligent caching with configurable TTL
   - Reduced timeout from 10s to 8s for faster response
   - Optimized retry logic with shorter backoff times
   - Background processing for GET requests

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Built-in performance metrics tracking
   - Request timing analysis
   - Cache hit/miss monitoring

4. **Critical Data Preloading**:
   - User data preloaded on app startup
   - Media list cached for faster access
   - Image preloading for better UX

#### Usage Examples:

```typescript
// Optimized button handling
import { useOptimizedButton } from './utils/performance';

const optimizedHandler = useOptimizedButton(handlePress, {
  debounceMs: 200,
  key: 'unique-button-id'
});

// Optimized data fetching
import { PerformanceOptimizer } from './utils/performance';

const data = await PerformanceOptimizer.optimizedFetch('cache-key', fetchFunction, {
  cacheDuration: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  background: true
});
```

## Comment System

A comprehensive comment system has been implemented to allow users to interact with content through comments.

### Features:

1. **Comment Modal**: Full-screen modal for viewing and posting comments
2. **Comment Button**: Reusable button component for content cards
3. **Comment Service**: Backend service for comment management
4. **Performance Optimized**: Uses caching and optimized data fetching

### Components:

- **`CommentModal.tsx`**: Main comment interface with list and input
- **`CommentButton.tsx`**: Reusable comment button for content cards
- **`CommentService.ts`**: Service for comment operations
- **`CommentDemo.tsx`**: Demo component showing usage

### Usage:

```typescript
import CommentButton from './components/CommentButton';

// In your content card
<CommentButton
  contentId="unique-content-id"
  contentTitle="Content Title"
  commentCount={5}
  onCommentPosted={(comment) => console.log('New comment:', comment)}
  size="medium"
  showCount={true}
/>
```

### Demo:

Visit `/comment-demo` to see the comment system in action with sample content cards.

### Features:

- âœ… Post comments on any content
- âœ… View existing comments with timestamps
- âœ… Like comments
- âœ… Responsive design for all devices
- âœ… Performance optimized with caching
- âœ… Local persistence for demo purposes
- âœ… Keyboard-aware modal
- âœ… Character limit (500 chars)
- âœ… Loading states and error handling

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
