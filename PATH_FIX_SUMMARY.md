# Path Fix Summary - Avatar Image Import

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Error**: `Unable to resolve "../assets/images/Avatar-1.png" from ContentCard.tsx`

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated the import path in ContentCard.tsx to match the project's file structure.

### Changes Made:

#### **Avatar Image Path**

```typescript
// ❌ Before (incorrect path)
defaultSource={require("../assets/images/Avatar-1.png")}

// ✅ After (correct path)
defaultSource={require("../../assets/images/Avatar-1.png")}
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The ContentCard component is located in `app/components/` directory, so it needs to go up two levels (`../../`) to reach the `assets/images/` folder, not just one level (`../`).

## ✅ Verification

- ✅ **Path matches project structure** - All other components use `../../assets/images/Avatar-1.png`
- ✅ **File exists** - `Avatar-1.png` is confirmed to exist in `assets/images/`
- ✅ **No linting errors** - Component compiles successfully

## 🚀 Result

The ContentCard component now correctly imports the default avatar image and should work without any path resolution errors!

jevahapp_frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ContentCard.tsx  ← Needs ../../ to reach assets
│   └── categories/
│       └── Allcontent.tsx   ← Also uses ../../ for assets
└── assets/
    └── images/
        └── Avatar-1.png    ← Target file
```

The fix is now complete! 🎉
