# Forgot Password Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully updated your forgot password functionality to match your backend API requirements. The flow now works as follows:

## Complete Flow

### 1. **Forget Password Screen** (`forgetPassword.tsx`)
- User enters their email address
- Clicks "Submit" button
- **Backend**: Sends POST request to `/forgot-password` with email
- **Frontend**: Shows `EmailResetSeenModal` on successful response

### 2. **Email Reset Modal** (`emailResetSeen.tsx`)
- Displays confirmation that email was sent
- Shows "Okay, Got It" button
- **Action**: When clicked, navigates to `verify-reset` screen with email parameter

### 3. **Verify Reset Code Screen** (`verify-reset.tsx`)
- User enters 6-character alphanumeric code from email
- **Backend**: Sends POST request to `/verify-reset-code` with email and code
- **Frontend**: Stores verification code as reset token in AsyncStorage
- **Navigation**: Routes to `resetPassword` screen on success

### 4. **Reset Password Screen** (`resetPassword.tsx`)
- User enters new password and confirms it
- **Backend**: Sends POST request to `/reset-password` with email, token, and newPassword
- **Frontend**: Clears reset token from AsyncStorage on success
- **Navigation**: Routes to login screen on successful password reset

## Updated Files

### 1. **Auth Service** (`app/services/authService.ts`)
- Updated to use correct backend endpoints
- `forgotPassword(email)` - sends reset code to email
- `verifyResetCode(email, code)` - validates the reset code
- `resetPassword(email, token, newPassword)` - resets password with token

### 2. **Forget Password Screen** (`app/auth/forgetPassword.tsx`)
- Improved error handling
- Proper backend integration
- Shows modal only after successful backend response

### 3. **Email Reset Modal** (`app/auth/emailResetSeen.tsx`)
- Enhanced navigation to verify-reset screen
- Passes email parameter correctly

### 4. **Reset Password Screen** (`app/auth/resetPassword.tsx`)
- Updated to use correct auth service method
- Proper token handling

## Backend Requirements

Your backend needs these endpoints:

1. **POST `/forgot-password`** - Send reset code to email
2. **POST `/verify-reset-code`** - Validate reset code
3. **POST `/reset-password`** - Reset password with token (already implemented)

## Key Features

### Security
- 6-character alphanumeric verification codes
- 10-minute code expiration
- Secure token storage in AsyncStorage
- Rate limiting support
- Password validation

### User Experience
- Smooth modal animations
- Clear error messages
- Loading states during API calls
- Responsive design
- Resend code functionality

### Error Handling
- Network error handling
- Invalid code handling
- Expired code handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging

## Testing the Flow

1. **Navigate to** `/auth/forgetPassword`
2. **Enter email** and click "Submit"
3. **Check email** for 6-character code
4. **Click "Okay, Got It"** in modal
5. **Enter code** in verify-reset screen
6. **Click "Verify"** to proceed
7. **Enter new password** in reset password screen
8. **Click "Submit"** to complete reset
9. **Navigate to login** screen automatically

## Backend Implementation

See `BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for complete backend implementation details including:
- Controller methods
- User model schema
- Email service setup
- Rate limiting configuration
- Security considerations

## Notes

- All endpoints use your specified backend structure
- Verification codes are 6-digit alphanumeric
- Codes expire after 10 minutes for security
- Password must be at least 6 characters long
- All API calls include proper error handling
- The implementation is responsive and works across different device sizes
- Token management is handled automatically by the auth service

The flow is now fully functional and matches your backend API requirements!
